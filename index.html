                <p>

                    House keys: they may be light or heavy, and you may carry them with little to no meaning. Personally, I consider them unstable objects in my life, accumulating them by the dozen. The longer I stay in one place, the less happiness I feel. Perhaps it's
                    a feeling or a sheer inability to appreciate any sort of routine. Often, the walls of a daily routine start to feel confining to me, and I feel the need to move again – places, houses, people.... With each move, of course, a different
                    key enters my life.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Since my teenage years, I've had a recurring dream that still visits me from time to time. In the dream, I find myself in front of my middle school, waiting for a bus that never comes. Consequently, in my dream, I have to walk home. The more I walk, the
                    less certain I am about where to go or where I am going. The various places I've called home blend together, and the paths leading there become indistinguishable. Gradually, I lose track of which home is mine. In that dream, the only
                    hint that I have somewhere to go is a key wrapped on a thread around my neck. Trapped in a loop of attempting to walk to 15 different homes, I lose hope, never finding my way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a few weeks now, I've been asked, "But are you really writing about keys?" I never formulated a true response. I didn’t really have one. Because in my mind, the direction I was going in made sense. But it was so hard to formulate the path that I was
                    taking, to put into words and to explain.

                </p>
                <p>
                    My tutor talked to me about kids and their keys around their neck, latchkey kids.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I had never put a specific name on it. If you remove the heavily negative connotation around it, I was part of them. I think in French culture, it’s quite common, young ones given keys to wear or to keep. Taught how to get to school from home and home
                    from school. It's only when we moved back to Paris (but by then I was just a teen with a key) that I really looked at what they had put in my hand. I remember being disappointed that it was a more modern-looking key.

                </p>
                <p>
                    There were three doors to open, one with a code, one with a push, and one with this disappointingly banal-looking key. But what made it a bit interesting in my mind was that even though I deemed it ugly, it held a certain value.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It meant, first of all, that all these years, I had somewhere to go, a path I had to learn. Trust, I had earned from a very young age to be able to carry something that opened to my family's possessions, to our vulnerable little world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All these keys around us, yet they belong to someone, and they open a whole other world that I didn’t have access to.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Our possessions, our dirty dishes, our painful family dinners, all hidden away thanks to one little metal object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, my key is my own, one that opens to clothes on the floor and a wig on the wall. Whereas when my key was just a duplicate of the one my parents had it would have opened to a well-made bed and hidden-away cigarettes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both were precious, they just did not have the same tonality or weight in my hands.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>It is and isn’t about keys, </p>
                <p> It’s about what they can mean. </p>
                <p> To me or to someone else </p>
                <p> But it is at least a little bit about them. </p>
                <br>
                <p>But as we are progressing, it is said that soon we will not ever use physical keys, instead we will implant chips in our hands, use facial or vocal recognition1. And with that the act of opening doors will never be or mean the same thing.
                </p>
                <p>are we never really satisfied of what we have? </p>
                <p>and in the hunt </p>
                <p>is it just the hunt? </p>
                <p>the cycle </p>
                <p>of it all</p>
                <p>but before they go </p>
                <p>let me</p>
                <p>talk about my keys.
                </p>

                <h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1 - Keys made me into an upside-down Pendulum</h2>

                <p>In The Philosophy of Instability,</p>
                <p>Ilya Prigogine explains the dynamics of a stable pendulum. When it's steady, its future motions can be anticipated. But once agitated or inverted, its movements enter a state of chaos. The system becomes unpredictable because it's highly
                    sensitive to how its moved. <sup>1</sup> </p>
                <span class="footnote"> Ilya Prigogine, <i>The Philosophy of Instability</i> 1989</span>

                <p>Unsure if the pendulum will swing left or right.</p>

                <p>I think many who've crossed borders or changed homes frequently, may be able to relate to this. </p>

                <p>A stable life, where things follow routine and outcomes are expected, you become in certain ways, similar to a pendulum, doing what its predicted to do. </p>

                <p>But when you change locations, multiple times, I believe it can mess with certain parts of your life, introducing a kind of chaos or small disruption. Like the inverted pendulum, your movement becomes uncertain. </p>

                <p>New places, people, and routines add that unpredictable rhythm, echoing the disorder in certain physical systems. </p>

                <p>This back-and-forth might influence how someone views change, maybe even creating a desire for it. It's like a dance between stability and unpredictability, akin to the pendulum swaying between order and chaos. </p>

                <p>Is it a search for more? Is it a search for home? Locking the door and never opening it again, constantly opening new ones. </p>

                <p>New key, new lock, new door, new space, new location, new life? </p>

                <p>When does it stop? </p>

                <p>When will you be satisfied? </p>

                <p>Why can’t this be enough for now? </p>

                <p>Maybe once you were dislodged too many times, turned upside down you can never be stable, not knowing what that looks like or feels like anymore? </p>

                <p>Maybe for some stability becomes found by disrupting it. </p>

                <p>Trying to find this interplay <span class="key">&#128477;</span> </p>
                <p> of settling in one place and moving around becomes a chase, a craving for the next best thing, something to disorder, to stop the boredom that can be induced from staying in a place for too long. </p>

                    Let’s assume for a moment that this might have happened. After all, it isn’t too far from reality when it comes to the condition of women and the objectification, they have gone through for centuries now. As well as in the later centuries such as the
                    15th it was quite common for women to carry their various keys around a belt<sup>4</sup></p> .

                    is owned. </p>
                <p>Using her key as a symbol of autonomy and authority within the domestic sphere. What comes to mind, is a certain reflection on the women’s mobility and independence being restricted, bound by this domestic sphere, a meaning that the keys
                    hold, hanging on her dress, clanking away at each step she took outside. </p>
                <p>Keys control access, determining who is allowed entry to certain spaces and who is not. </p>
                <p>Possessions, that is what a key opens to after all.</p>
                <p>And all this makes me think of the act of giving keys to woman like a surface action telling them they are safe. </p>
                <p>Access, possession </p>
                <p>Inside and outside</p>
                <p> If you wear them on the outside of your dress isn’t that not just about access to an inside anymore?</p>
                <p>All of this, what I’m trying to say to pin, and point might be easier if I use the blue beard story as an example. A tale that has many different interpretations, the most famous one being by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du
                    temps passé , it tells the story of Bluebeard, a wealthy man who no one wants to marry because of his eccentric personality and appearance, it doesn’t help that all six of his previous wives have disappeared. One girl accepts his wedding
                    proposal, making her his seventh wife. He one day leaves on a trip and entrusts her with all the keys to his castle that she now shares with him. To this set of keys is included the one to a secret chamber which he forbids her of accessing,
                    if she does, he will kill her. </p>

                <p>But give someone a key, forbid them to go into a room and leave them for a few days, temptation wins. In she goes, horrified at the view of what she has unlocked, the 6 bloody bodies of the missing wives lay in front of her, the key drops
                    into the blood.This bloodied key, will be the tell-tale for blue beard to know that his wife has been inside the forbidden room. He tries to kill her, but she is saved by her brothers. </p>
                <p>In Women who run with the wolves , Clarrisa Pinkola Estés goes over myths and tales such as blue beard, where she elaborates on this key, saying that once the wife has decided to use it to open the door, she unlocks consciousness, to see
                    things as they are instead of being the designated devoted wife.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Tales of women being locked away, don’t derail so far from the reality of today, not just physically but also mentally bound to this domestic world that has been constructed over the centuries by expectations of what is to be a woman,
                    a wife a mother. Hand them keys, it isn’t just to lock and unlock, it is telling them silently what is expected of them, bearer of the keys, blindly trust the men of the house, hold it all together. You turn them into a skeleton key,
                    stripping them of their desires, shaping and filing them down turning them into tools to access what you need.</p>

                <p>
                    The association between keys and power has always existed. Keys control access, determining who is allowed entry to certain spaces and who is not. This authority can be seen in the case of master keys , as they possess the ability to unlock multiple doors
                    within a designed system. The owner of a master key holds a level of control that goes beyond an individual space, granting them access to many possibilities inaccessible to others.
                </p>
                <p>The master key system is primarily used in institutions such as hotels, office buildings, or apartment complexes. With a turn of the key, a push on the door by a custodian, they gain entry to offices and storage rooms but also to restricted
                    areas that are off-limits to the non-master keyers ,giving to the custodian the power to navigate the entire building with ease, in order to fulfill their duties. As well as the responsibility of exercising their authority fairly to
                    maintain the integrity of the spaces they must oversee.</p>
                <p>If in the wrong hands master keys granting entry to all spaces <span class="key">&#128477;</span>within said building could possibly compromise the safety of occupants</p>
                <p>Keys also embody the notion of freedom and captivity, capable of releasing or constraining. In many situations, if you possess keys, you have control over who can enter these spaces; you hold the power to grant or deny entry. If you are
                    the sole owner of these keys, in certain ways (depending on one's situation), you have access to a certain freedom; you don't rely on others. You are the one to turn the key in the lock, locking yourself in and out as you please, not
                    being bound by another influence of power.</p>
                <p>The surrender of keys during war historically symbolized letting go of control or authority over a city. This act of surrender often occurred when the defending force realized that further resistance was pointless, and that they did not
                    stand a chance compared to the attacking force. Surrendering keys took various forms, such as physically handing over the keys to the gates of the city, or it was a symbolic gesture where the keys were presented to the victorious commander.</p>
                <p>Giving up control to the bigger force, unsure if you can trust the safety of what you have kept, onto the hands of someone else.</p>

                <h2 id="epilogue">Conclusion</h2>

                <p>
                    From the clank of a latchkey kids' pendant to the weight of responsibility carried by a Viking woman’s house key, keys are wrapped around with themes of stability and instability, autonomy and authority, freedom and captivity.
                    <span class="key">&#128477;</span>
                </p>
                <p>Through somewhat personal reflections, tales and historical situations, we have walked through a part of the vast landscape of human experience within the metal dented objects we carry every day.</p>
                <p>As we stand at the edge of an era where physical keys may soon be entirely replaced by digital codes and biometric scans, the essence of keys still lies. They represent power, identity and transition. Whether they hang from a belt in medieval
                    times or are clutched in the palm of our hands, they symbolise our desire for access, control and meaning in an ever-changing world.</p>
                <p>In the end, maybe the true significance of our keys isn't in the metal or plastic from which they are crafted, but in the stories, they are a part of, the memories they hold and the doors they open, both literal and metaphorical. As we
                    navigate the map i hope we cherish the keys we carry, for they are not just tools of entry, but they are keepers of what we knew, what we know, and what is to come.</p>
